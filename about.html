		<p>Hi, I am Alyx. I was born and raised in Vermont. I love the outdoors, animals and art. I have a Doberman Pinscher named Gunnar, he joins me on many of my adventures, and I have a bearded dragon named Wendy.</p> 
		<br> 
		<p>	I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a BA in Illustration and received two minors, one in Art History the other in American Sign Language and Deaf Culture Studies. Many people are not aware that RIT has a has a deaf population of about 11%. It was important to me to be able to communicate with the deaf students in my classes. I really enjoyed learning sign language, I am a visual person and it is a visual language - makes sense! </p> 
		<br>
		<p> Currently I work as a designer for a large automotive website company. In a nutshell I crate a high volume of vehicle offers that are seen on the websites and in display ads.</p> 
		<br> 
		<p> I have always loved learning new skills, which means I have too many hobbies. For a more creative outlet I enjoy knitting/crochetting, various kinds of art, woodworking, home reno projects (I flipped my old house, took 3 years but I did it!) I could go on. </p>
		<br>
		<p> One of the more unique hobbies I have is <a href="euromount.html">taxidermy</a>. I started creating European Mounts about 4 years ago and enjoy the process. I learn a lot about anatomy and I find it relaxing and rewarding. I actually paid for one of my tattoos with a coyote skull I did!</p>
		<br>
		<p>I hope you enjoy my work! Any questions please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me!</a></p>
